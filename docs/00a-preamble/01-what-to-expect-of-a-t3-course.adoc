=== What does a Train-the-Trainer course convey?

A train-the-trainer course will enable (future) trainers to efficiently and effectively deliver high-quality training content in iSAQB-accredited trainings.

It is primarily intended for trainers and prospective trainers who conduct or intend to conduct iSAQB CPSA Foundation-Level trainings, but does not exclude software architecture trainers at other levels from participating.

It enables new iSAQB accredited trainers a fast start into training delivery, improves the quality of their training delivery by providing efficient knowledge transfer and exam preparation to their training participants.

It offers continuing education for accredited software architecture trainers and prepares future software architecture trainers for accreditation.

It communicates iSAQBâ€™s values and objectives to new trainers.

It conveys knowledge of didactics, education methodology, and psychology of learning with relevance towards iSAQB-accredited software architecture trainings.

It assure that trainers are well-versed in the iSAQB CPSA curricula and share a common understanding of the corresponding concepts.
Share best practices and lessons learned from experienced trainers.

However, a T3 training is neither a guarantee for passing the trainer accreditation nor is it a prerequisite.
