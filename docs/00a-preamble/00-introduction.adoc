== iSAQB^®^ Core Values and Code of Conduct

The iSAQB^®^ is built on shared values that guide our software architecture education work.
We strive to provide high-quality training that enables people worldwide to build better software systems.
These core values shape our approach to training, community building, and professional development.

*Professional Excellence & Authenticity*::
iSAQB^®^ members are distinguished by being active professionals in the academia and software industry who bring observations and learnings gained from practical experience implementing and operating systems in production.
This isn't just theoretical knowledge but real-world expertise from designing and implementing actual systems.

*Knowledge Sharing as a Mission*::
What makes the iSAQB^®^ different is our genuine passion to share practical knowledge and grow it through feedback of diverse perspectives.
Our members teach not primarily for profit, but because they believe in the importance of spreading quality architectural practices and elevating the profession as a whole.

*Quality Over Quantity*::
The iSAQB^®^ prioritizes the excellence of training - ensuring participants gain knowledge for which they also learned how to apply it to their daily work - rather than maximizing the number of certifications issued or courses delivered.
This focus on quality ensures meaningful learning experiences that translate to real-world impact.

*Practical Application*::
The emphasis is on enabling people to design better software systems in practice, building sustainable software which provides actual value to humans, not just teaching theory or earning certifications.

*Community & Continuous Learning*::
There's a dual commitment to both teaching and learning, creating a community where everyone - including the trainers - continues to grow and adapt to evolving best practices through personalizable localized and continuously improving learning experiences.

*Inclusive & Respectful Environment*::
The iSAQB^®^ values creating a welcoming environment for diverse participants, recognizing that the best architectural solutions come from considering multiple perspectives and enabling community-based exchange for people with software design experience.

To ensure our community reflects these values, the iSAQB^®^ maintains a Code of Conduct <<isaqb-coc>> that fosters open expression while protecting everyone's well-being and dignity.
We encourage constructive dialogue and recognize that in diverse community settings, people may unknowingly cause offense. 

Our Code of Conduct serves three key purposes: providing guidance on respectful behavior, signaling that our community welcomes everyone — especially those from underrepresented groups in tech — and offering clear guidelines for event organizers and moderators.
This Code is not intended to restrict free expression, but rather to ensure that such expression does not infringe upon others' rights and well-being.
It outlines our expectations for all participants in iSAQB^®^ spaces and events, along with appropriate responses to unacceptable behavior.

We invite everyone in our community to help create safe, respectful, and enriching experiences for all participants.

== Introduction: General Information About the iSAQB's T3 Course

A Train-the-Trainer (T3) course is designed to enable trainers to efficiently and effectively deliver high-quality training content in iSAQB^®^-accredited trainings.
It is primarily intended for trainers and prospective trainers who conduct or intend to conduct iSAQB^®^ CPSA Foundation-Level trainings, but will not exclude software architecture trainers at other levels from participating.
It focuses on enhancing expertise in the subject matter, effective teaching methods, creating a positive learning environment, and professional training delivery.
Participants learn to design and deliver engaging, high-quality courses, manage group dynamics, and handle challenging training situations.
The course also emphasizes continuous improvement and alignment with iSAQB^®^ values and standards.
While it enhances training delivery skills, it is not a prerequisite for trainer accreditation.
