==== Notes from NextCloud

_Draft by Alfredo Delgado Sanchez  and  Ralf Leipner_


_Comments by ALZ:_ Reduce and clarify - are those things that participants ...

* should already bring with them (prerequisites),
* are we going to train them or is this
* something they should work on afterwards?

e.g.: "This is a profile for those who are already iSAQB trainers." or "This is what you should be/become as a trainer.â€œ

* Provide "scenarios" what do we mean by this competence,
* Ranking (before T3T, after T3T, long term importance)
* Provide Info on whether this is covered in the T3T.

Let's build a quality tree, operationalize it for motivating LUs.

[discrete]
===== 1. Subject matter competence

* The trainer is familiar with the subject matter. 
* He/she is an expert, has knowledge of the subject matter.
* The trainer can refer to practical experience.
* He/she keeps his knowledge up to date. This is the solid basis of any training. Without expert knowledge, the trainer cannot demonstrate confidence. 
* The trainer should in broad have more expert knowledge than the participants. This is at least easier. 
* Typical questions are: 
* What should I know about the subject?
* What should my expertise on the topic cover?
* Is my expertise up to date?
* What questions might be asked during the training?


[discrete]
===== 2. Methodical competence

* How do I design a training course?  - Trainers can design a training course.
* How do I communicate content in a comprehensible way?
* How do adults learn?
* How do I achieve the teaching objectives?
* How do I make a training lively and sustainable?
* How do I prepare content in a way that is suitable for the brain?
* Which media do I use?
* Which methods can I use?
* How do I keep participants "on their toes"?
* How do I speak in an interesting and varied way?
* How do I use my body language?
* How do I motivate participants?


[discrete]
===== 3. Social competence

* How do I build a good group atmosphere?
* How do I shape group processes?
* How do I deal with conflicts and troublemakers?
* How do I give feedback?
* How do I build a good relationship with participants?

[discrete]
===== 4. Personality competence

* How do I motivate myself?
* How do I achieve a good mood at the beginning of the training?
* How do I radiate confidence and competence?
* How do I deal with stress?
* How do I use my personal resources optimally in the training?

===== Wording and Terms

For clarification: A T3 trainer is a person who conducts/gives a train-the-trainer training. This does not mean the training participants or future foundation-level trainers.

[discrete]
===== Experience and skills that we believe a T3 trainer should have

* At least "quite a bit more experience than a regular trainer".

* Extensive experience in giving training, e.g. already X training days delivered and providing training for Y years.
** X= 50-100 training days? Y = 2-3 years? What is our opinion on this.

* Background knowledge of didactics.  Not only advisable, but required in the way that they have studied this or can present equivalent knowledge.
** This is a very high barrier. What kind of "proof" do we accept?
** Could be checked by having a examination committee/panel.
** For this panel we should include a person who has background on this.
** We don't really require a formal degree, but candidate should proof knowledge.

* Along with the training experience, practical experience working in software industry or hands on with design/development assignments.
** Eg: Person may be a good trainer of ISTQB, IREB, PMP ... certification but may not have great examples if he/she has no sound background of software development/design. It would be advisable to have that
** Should have cleared at least the FL exam


[discrete]
===== Further prerequisites

* The trainer must have access to accredited training material to use it as example on how to provide a training.
* This material *might* be provided by iSAQB GmbH.

[CAUTION]
====
There is an ongoing discussion about whether the training material currently distributed by iSAQB GmbH (reference slide set) should be mandatory to be used as an example in T3 trainings. This could be made available to T3 trainers specifically for this purpose. From the point of view of internationalization, this makes sense, but there are also arguments against it. We are in the process of forming an opinion and collecting pro and con arguments.

*Pro's*

* We understand why a standardized slide deck is a good thing for the international market. New trainers outside DACH will very likely use it and should be trained with it.

*Con's*

* Limits options and freedom of choice for T3 trainers.
* Can not be acquired for usage inside DACH, therefore many existing trainers do not know it.
* Trainers know their own material very well and can give hands-on-examples on how to use it.

*Alternative Solutions*

* It should be a mandatory part of the course description to specify which training material is used as an example. This gives training participants a basis for evaluating whether this or another T3 training is useful for them.
