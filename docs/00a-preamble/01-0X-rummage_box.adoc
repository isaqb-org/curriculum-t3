==== Notes from NextCloud

_Draft by Alfredo Delgado Sanchez  and  Ralf Leipner_


_Comments by ALZ:_ Reduce and clarify - are those things that participants ...

* should already bring with them (prerequisites),
* are we going to train them or is this
* something they should work on afterwards?

e.g.: "This is a profile for those who are already iSAQB trainers." or "This is what you should be/become as a trainer.â€œ

* Provide "scenarios" what do we mean by this competence,
* Ranking (before T3T, after T3T, long term importance)
* Provide Info on whether this is covered in the T3T.
