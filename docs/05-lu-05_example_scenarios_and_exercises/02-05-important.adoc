This Learning Unit is specifically designed for Train-the-Trainer participants (T3P) and is not part of the Foundation Level curriculum. Key points for T3 trainers to emphasize include:

* Leveraging existing knowledge and past experience to develop effective example scenarios
* The value of using real-world examples from personal project experience
* The importance of being able to provide detailed explanations and context when students ask questions
* How to adapt and extend scenarios based on participants' inquiries
* The balance between using pre-prepared scenarios and drawing from personal experience
* Techniques for making abstract concepts concrete through relatable examples
* The importance of scenario flexibility to accommodate different learning styles and backgrounds

Remember, the ability to draw from personal experience enhances the trainer's credibility and helps participants connect theoretical concepts to practical applications.
This approach also allows for more dynamic and engaging discussions during the training session.
