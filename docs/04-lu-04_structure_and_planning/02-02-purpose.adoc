Breaking a course curriculum down into a course structure "that works" and brings value to students.
Course structures "that work" take into consideration the prerequisites and needs of the participants, the required coverage of the curriculum, and the time constraints imposed on the course - and possibly the implications of the course format (presence vs. online vs. online over a longer time period).
At the end of the day, a specific timetable with course units, exercises and possible additional activities must be created.
