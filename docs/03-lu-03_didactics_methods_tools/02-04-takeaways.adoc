Training adult professionals differs significantly from teaching students. Keep in mind:

* You're facilitating peers, not instructing subordinates
* Leverage participants' diverse professional experiences to enrich discussions
* Be prepared to justify the practical value of each topic
* Expect and manage challenging questions that may go beyond the curriculum
* Balance theoretical concepts with immediate, real-world applications
* Adapt quickly to different industry perspectives and potential disagreements
* Respect participants' time by ensuring all content is directly applicable to their work
* Anticipate, prevent, and professionally handle difficult training situations to maintain a constructive and inclusive learning environment
