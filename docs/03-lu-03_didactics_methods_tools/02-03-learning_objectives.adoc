// tag::REMARK[]
[sidebar]
The learning objective(s) that are covered by the LU. Try to formulate learning goals as a learning outcome by using the formula "Behavior + Concept or Skill = Learning Outcome" (see Bowman, Training from the Back of the room, chapter "Begin with the end"). E. g. "Future trainers can adapt a learning unit to the target audience and can explain the necessary adaptation steps."

[[LG-3-1]]
==== LG 3-1: Adult learning and blooms taxonomy
T3P should be able to describe the unique characteristics and special challenges of adult learning, including handling heterogeneous groups with different skill levels and backgrounds.
They should know the training relevant parts of blooms taxonomy and be able to map the needs and expectations of participants to them.

[[LG-3-2]]
==== LG 3-2: Learning Objectives and benefits
T3P should be able to explain the importance and benefits of clear, concise, and verifiable learning objectives.
They should be able to formulate such learning objectives and to show how each part of the training maps to one or more of them.
They should be able to adapt learning objectives for younger and/or less experienced participants.
T3P should be able to handle incomplete/inconsistent knowledge and different perspectives on topics and concepts.

[discrete]
[[LG-3-3]]
==== LG 3-3: Attention and learning performance
T3P should know factors that influence attention of learners (e.g. usual attention span, time of day, relation to breaks, tiredness, ... ) and be able to adjust the timing of the training and adapt training methods accordingly.

[discrete]
[[LG-3-4]]
==== LG 3-4: Distraction factors and learning performance
T3P should recognize and be able to describe distraction factors that impact learning. They know and can apply strategies to reduce and/or mitigate distractions. 
This includes:

* Identifying early warning signs of potential challenges that might affect learning
* Implementing preventive measures to minimize distractions
* Managing knowledge level mismatches within participant groups
* Addressing technical issues that may disrupt the learning process
* Converting potentially disruptive situations into learning opportunities

[discrete]
[[LG-3-5]]
==== LG 3-5: Training methods
T3P should be able to describe and apply a variety of different training methods and can describe how a change of method influences learning outcomes.
They should be familiar with different methods and concepts, such as the 4Cs by Sharon Bowman <<bowman>>, and be able to apply opening and closing methods.
T3P should understand how to use exercises, demos, and case studies effectively, including grouping participants for exercises (see LU05) and be able explain the trade-offs between short and simple exercises vs. complex scenarios, case studies, and continuous exercises. 

T3P should be able to provide and request feedback, use various feedback methods, and objectively evaluate participant feedback.
They should also be proficient in:

* Facilitating interactive classroom discussions and practical application of theory
* Employing techniques to activate participants and improve learner engagement
* Using various media and teaching tools effectively, including haptic (e.g., flipcharts, whiteboards) and digital (e.g., PowerPoint, survey tools, videos) resources
* Applying collaboration and distance learning tools (e.g., Teams, Zoom, digital whiteboards like Miro) for virtual training environments

[[LG-3-6]]
==== LG 3-6: Communication and presentation skills for trainers
T3P should be able to demonstrate effective communication and presentation skills essential for training delivery.
This includes:

* Understanding and applying basic rules of rhetoric
* Using appropriate language in the classroom, considering the various dimensions of communication
* Employing effective body language to enhance training delivery
* Developing strategies to manage stage fright and maintain composure during presentations
* Handling non-constructive behavior, disturbances, and conflicts between participants professionally
* Applying conflict resolution techniques when necessary
* Facilitating inclusive and productive group discussions
* Adapting communication style to different audience needs and knowledge levels
* Maintaining professional composure during difficult interactions
* Applying appropriate escalation procedures when necessary
