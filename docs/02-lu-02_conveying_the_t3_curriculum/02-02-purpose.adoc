While future FL trainers should have a solid professional background on software archtitecture as a prerequisite, not everyone will know every detail of the FL curriculum's content.
During a T3 training session, possible knowledge gaps must be identified and addressed.

In addition, the FL curriculum only defines *what* should be taught, but does not provide explanations of the content or best practices for teaching it. 
In some areas of the discipline of software architecture, there is not yet a normative body of knowledge or a consolidated view on certain concepts and methods. 
So it is a matter of communicating the iSAQB's view (or sometimes the multiplicity of views).

Last but not least, the learning goals of the FL curriculum also provide a good basis for demonstrating how content can be didactically prepared and delivered and allows participants to actively practice this.
Therefore, piggybacking the other learning goals of the curriculum on the basis of this learning unit is recommended.
