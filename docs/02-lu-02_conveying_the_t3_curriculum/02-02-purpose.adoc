While future FL trainers should have a solid professional background on software architecture as a prerequisite, not everyone will know every detail of the FL curriculum's content.
During a T3 training session, possible knowledge gaps must be identified and addressed.

The FL curriculum only defines *what* should be taught, but does not provide explanations of the content or best practices for teaching it.
In some areas of the discipline of software architecture, there is not yet a normative body of knowledge or a consolidated view on certain concepts and methods.
Therefore, communicating the iSAQB^®^'s perspective (or sometimes multiple perspectives) is essential.

LU02 serves as the primary vehicle for both ensuring content mastery and demonstrating practical training skills.
By working through the FL curriculum in LU02, we simultaneously practice and demonstrate the skills from other learning units, in particular:

* *LU03:* Didactic methods for effective teaching
* *LU04:* Course structure and scheduling
* *LU05:* Creating example scenarios and exercises

This integrated approach ensures participants not only understand the FL curriculum thoroughly but also learn how to effectively teach it through practical application.

For more details on how LU02 integrates with other learning units through practical implementation, see the "Important" section of this LU, which explains the hands-on approach to training delivery.
