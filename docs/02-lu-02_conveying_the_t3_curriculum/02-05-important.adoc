What are particular important points that a T3 trainer should highlight or prioritize (because it is of outstanding relevance for future trainers).

This is *not* a LU intended to be delivered as a standalone part of a T3 training.
Instead, it runs throughout the course and serves as a vehicle to explain the learning goals of the other units.
It provides participants with an opportunity to practice what they have learned in a real-life setting while simultaneously exploring the contents of the T3 curriculum.

We propose the following approach to ensure T3P thoroughly understand and can effectively teach the FL curriculum:

* Guide T3P through a comprehensive Foundation Level training slide set:
** Explain presentation techniques for various concepts
** Emphasize critical points
** Identify and address potential "show stoppers"
** Demonstrate strategies to overcome common challenges

* Assign curriculum sections to T3P:
** Divide content into manageable parts
** Have T3P present their sections as if delivering a real FL training
** Provide immediate, constructive feedback on:
*** Presentation style
*** Content delivery
*** Handling of potential questions or difficulties

* Encourage T3P to:
** Draw from personal experience when explaining concepts
** Adapt explanations to different audience backgrounds
** Prepare for and practice answering in-depth questions

This method allows T3P to experience firsthand the challenges of curriculum delivery while providing a safe environment for practice and improvement.

The hands-on approach helps T3P internalize both curriculum content and effective training techniques, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.


In general, LU02 serves as the central element of the entire T3 curriculum, surrounded by complementary learning units (LUs). The iSAQB^®^'s CPSA-FL curriculum forms the foundation of LU02, which is a prerequisite for T3 participants, as future accredited CPSA trainers, to fully master and understand.
Alongside transferring the knowledge points from the CPSA-FL curriculum into a well-structured CPSA training program, T3 participants are also tasked with addressing questions raised by CPSA training participants and guiding them in their preparation for the CPSA exam.

Additionally, appropriate didactic methods need to be developed by each individual T3 participant. Since different CPSA trainers may have their own strengths and weaknesses, various didactic methods may be more or less suitable for them. It usually takes time for each T3 participant to identify their optimal teaching strategies. However, applying diverse didactic methods within the CPSA training—rather than homogenously teaching in a theoretical manner—facilitates participants’ understanding of the knowledge points provided.
This will enable T3 participants, as future accredited CPSA trainers, to effectively evaluate the learning performance of their trainees. Example scenarios and exercises can invigorate the training atmosphere and enhance participants' mastery of abstract concepts, representing a unique and marketable aspect of individual CPSA trainers.
Each T3 participant should be able to integrate their distinctive example scenarios and exercises, as specified in the learning objectives of LU04, into the training. Given that explaining example scenarios and conducting exercises collaboratively with CPSA training participants can be time-consuming, a well-structured approach and effective time scheduling, as described in LU05, will be beneficial.

During the CPSA training, trainers can organize a brief session introducing the iSAQB^®^ organization and the CPSA exam, following communication with the iSAQB^®^ board and certification body. This will help familiarize CPSA training participants with the exam environment, boosting their confidence and enabling them to handle subsequent exams more effectively.
In addition, CPSA trainers usually also work together with the training provider for organizing the CPSA exam. All these operational aspects like communication and organization-related activities are also included as learning objectives in LU06 of this T3 curriculum.
