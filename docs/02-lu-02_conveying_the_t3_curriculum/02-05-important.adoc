What are particular important points that a T3 trainer should highlight or prioritize (because it is of outstanding relevance for future trainers).

This is *not* a LU intended to be delivered as a standalone part of a T3 training.
Instead, it runs throughout the course and serves as a vehicle to explain the learning goals of the other units.
It provides participants with an opportunity to practice what they have learned in a real-life setting while simultaneously exploring the contents of the T3 curriculum.

We propose the following approach to ensure T3P thoroughly understand and can effectively teach the FL curriculum:

* Guide T3P through a comprehensive Foundation Level training slide set:
** Explain presentation techniques for various concepts
** Emphasize critical points
** Identify and address potential "show stoppers"
** Demonstrate strategies to overcome common challenges

* Assign curriculum sections to T3P:
** Divide content into manageable parts
** Have T3P present their sections as if delivering a real FL training
** Provide immediate, constructive feedback on:
*** Presentation style
*** Content delivery
*** Handling of potential questions or difficulties

* Encourage T3P to:
** Draw from personal experience when explaining concepts
** Adapt explanations to different audience backgrounds
** Prepare for and practice answering in-depth questions

This method allows T3P to experience firsthand the challenges of curriculum delivery while providing a safe environment for practice and improvement.

The hands-on approach helps T3P internalize both curriculum content and effective training techniques, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.
