* Methods - add this to didactics later
** One possibility to make sure that T3P know the curricukum is by going through a slide set for a foundation level training, explaining to the T3P how things are presented, what has to be emphasized, what show stoppers to expect, etc. AND by letting the T3P having a go atÂ  doing this by themselves, e.g. by handing out parts of the training to them and by providing feedback.
