The curriculum is neither a textbook nor a blueprint for a FL course.
It defines the scope and content of what should be covered, but not the didactical path or delivery methods.
What truly matters for T3P participants is experiencing a complete walkthrough of an existing FL course delivered by an experienced trainer.
This hands-on demonstration shows how all the curriculum elements come together in practice - how content is structured, paced, and delivered effectively to create impactful training.
Through this guided experience, you'll gain clarity on what truly matters and develop the skills to deliver impactful, high-quality, engaging training to your own audience.
