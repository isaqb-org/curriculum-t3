== Maintainers

This repository is currently maintained by the iSAQB Train-the-Trainer Working Group (T3WG).
It was forked from https://github.com/isaqb-org/advanced-template currently maintained by Benjamin Wolf, which in turn was forked from https://github.com/isaqb-org/curriculum-template,
so the contributors of those projects basically contributed to this one, too.
