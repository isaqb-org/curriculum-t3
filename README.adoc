== On writing style

To keep writing style consistent accross multiple iSAQB documents, please apply the styles used in the Foundation Level Curriculum.

=== Heading Capitalization

Use title case for all headings:

* capitalize: first and last word, nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs
* lowercase: articles and prepositions

When in doubt, opt for https://capitalizemytitle.com/style/Chicago/[Chicago Style].

=== Bullet Point Lists

To unify upper/lowercase within the (EN) version, we use the _Chicago manual of style proposal_":

* short bullet items don't get a full-stop
* next one starts lowercase
* if bullets are phrases or fragments, dont use punctuation
* if and only if an item is a really long sentence which deserves a full stop, or consists of several sentences, then we use it.
* Only then does an item start with uppercase.

For a possible German (DE) version, don't use punctuation at the end of bullet-list items, unless on ends-of-sentences.


== Maintainers

This repository is currently maintained by the iSAQB Train-the-Trainer Working Group (T3WG).
It was forked from https://github.com/isaqb-org/advanced-template currently maintained by Benjamin Wolf, which in turn was forked from https://github.com/isaqb-org/curriculum-template,
so the contributors of those projects basically contributed to this one, too.
